#TMDB Demo
##Setup
###API
To use the API you'll need to configure your TMDB API key which can be obtained from your account on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/account). Once you have generated a key you'll need to add it as a gradle property named: `TMDB_API_KEY` for example in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or similar.
